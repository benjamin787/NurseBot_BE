# NurseBot_BE

A node.js server hosted on Heroku. Its primary uses are hosting the integration with Google's NLP - Dialogflow - and a webhook
to find information depending on the 'intent' determined by the former.  The goal is to create functions to increase the complexity
of what the chatbot can handle conversationaly.  This response is sent to NurseBot-FE for UX/UI.

### Prerequisites

Before continuing, you will need a basic knowledge of node.js and its most recent version. To test locally, you will need to host
through **ngrok**, as Dialogflow requires an https connection.

### Installation && Usage

Fork the repo, clone, and *npm install* to get caught up with dependencies.
